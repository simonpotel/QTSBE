```json
{
    "prefix": ".",
    "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
    "discord_id": "YOUR_DISCORD_ID"
}
```

For your main bot, use `.` as the prefix. For a local development version, use `%`.

To obtain `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, create an application on [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).

Find the Discord ID by right-clicking the Discord server icon and selecting "Copy ID" with Developer Mode enabled in settings.
