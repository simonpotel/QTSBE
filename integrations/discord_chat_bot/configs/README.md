```json
{
    "prefix": "!",
    "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
}
```

It is preferable to use `!` as the prefix for your main bot and `$` for a local version used for development tests. You can find the `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` by creating an application on [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
